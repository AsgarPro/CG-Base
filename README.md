# _CG-Base_ Rendering Framework

_CG-Base_ is a modern rendering framework, abstracting the actual rendering APIs without sacrificing on understandability and offering some nifty features to get you into gears rather quickly. 

_CG-Base_'s core principles are:
* Accelerate low-level graphics development,
* don't be a black-box but rather crystal-clear in expressing what's going on under the hood,
* abstract different rendering APIs,
* but still be helpful in learning and mastering one specific rendering API,
* be a modern framework that is fun to use.

Support for the following rendering APIs is currently in development:
* OpenGL 4.6
* OpenGL ES 3.2
* Vulkan

To get a first impression of how it is to use _CG-Base_, here is how to load and render a 3D model:
