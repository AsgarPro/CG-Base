# "Model Explorer" Example's Root Folder

This is the root directory of the "Model Explorer" example. It contains all the source code for the example. This example does not need additional asset files, i.e. only those from the framework's root directory are copied to the output directory.

This example allows the user to load a 3D model from file and navigate it freely.
