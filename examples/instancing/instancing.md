# "Instancing" Example's Root Folder

This is the root directory of the "Instancing" example. It contains all the source code for the example. This example does not need additional asset files, i.e. only those from the framework's root directory are copied to the output directory.

In this example, the user can choose to load a 3D-model file. Instead of rendering the 3D-model's faces, for each of its vertices, a geometric shape is rendered using GPU-instancing.
